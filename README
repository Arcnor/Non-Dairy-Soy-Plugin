Why a Plugin for Closure Templates?
    Simply put, our team started using Closure Templates in our project because
    they are nifty. As an avid IntelliJ IDEA user in an IntelliJ IDEA shop, I
    was disappointed there wasn't one already.

    Wait, I can write Java code, why not a plugin for the most awesome Java IDE
    around?
